## Sort Data

This project will make you sort data on a stack, with a limited set of instructions, using
the lowest possible number of actions. <br>
To succeed I had to manipulate various
types of algorithms and choose the most appropriate solution (out of many) for an
optimized data sorting. <br>
This project is in rank 2 of 42 common core and had passed with the score of 84.<br>

## Script

The only file in this repository is the script that i nedded to run on my VM.<br>
For obvious reasons i can't put my VM in here so the script coded in shell is here.<br>
I used the crontab system to run this scrip during a specific time.
