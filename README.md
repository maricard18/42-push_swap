## Sort Data

This project will make you sort data on a stack, with a limited set of instructions, using
the lowest possible number of actions. <br>
To succeed I had to manipulate various
types of algorithms and choose the most appropriate solution (out of many) for an
optimized data sorting. <br>
This project is in rank 2 of 42 common core and had passed with the score of 84.<br>
